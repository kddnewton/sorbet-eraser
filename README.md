# Sorbet::Eraser

Erase all traces of `sorbet-runtime` code.

`sorbet` is a great tool for development. However, in production, it incurs a penalty because it still functions as Ruby code. Even if you completely shim all `sorbet-runtime` method calls (for example by replacing `sig {} ` with a method that immediately returns) you still pay the cost of a method call in the first place.

This gem takes a different approach, but entirely eliminating the `sig` method call (as well as all the other `sorbet-runtime` constructs) from the source before Ruby compiles it.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "sorbet-eraser"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sorbet-eraser

## Usage

Before any code is loaded that would require a `sorbet-runtime` construct, call `require "sorbet/eraser/autoload"`. This will hook into the autoload process to erase all `sorbet-runtime` code before it gets passed to Ruby to parse.

Alternatively, you can programmatically use this gem through the `Sorbet::Eraser.erase(source)` API, where `source` is a string that represents valid Ruby code. Ruby code without the listed constructs will be returned.

Finally, this gem ships with a CLI that you can use to modify source files. This is useful for development of this gem itself, but could be useful for others to ensure they see what this gem actually will be doing in production. To run it, run:

```sh
bundle exec sorbet-eraser '**/*.rb'
```

It accepts any number of filepaths/patterns on the command line and will modify the source files with their erased contents.

### Status

Below is a table of the status of each `sorbet-runtime` construct and its current support status.

| Construct                                           | Status | Replacement |

| `class Foo < T::Struct`                             | ðŸ›      | Shimmed     |
| `sig`                                               | âœ…     | Removed     |
| `T.absurd(foo)`                                     | âœ…     | Shimmed     |
| `T.assert_type!(foo, bar)`                          | âœ…     | `foo`       |
| `T.bind(self, foo)`                                 | âœ…     | `self`      |
| `T.cast(foo, bar)`                                  | âœ…     | `foo`       |
| `T.let(foo, bar)`                                   | âœ…     | `foo`       |
| `T.must(foo)`                                       | âœ…     | `foo`       |
| `T.reveal_type(foo)`                                | âœ…     | `foo`       |
| `T.type_alias { foo }`                              | âœ…     | Shimmed     |
| `T.unsafe(foo)`                                     | âœ…     | `foo`       |

In the above table:

* `Shimmed` means that this gem provides a replacement module that will simply do nothing when its respective methods are called. We do this in order to maintain the same interface in the case that someone is doing runtime reflection. Also because anything that is shimmed will not be called that much/will not be in a hot path so performance is not really a consideration for those cases.
* `Removed` means that the construct is removed entirely from the source.
* Anything else means that the inputted code is replaced with that output.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
